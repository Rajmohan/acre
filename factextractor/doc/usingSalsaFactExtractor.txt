1.  To use the SALSA fact extractor, you need ANT (to build it) and a 1.5 JDK
    (to run it).  At the time of writing, the 1.5 JDKs are still betas, but
    they seem to work fine.
	
2.  Acquire and unpack the SALSA fact extractor distribution.  It should look
    something like this:
    	build.xml
	run
	winrun
	doc/<stuff>
	src/com/sun/tools/jackpot/<stuff>
	src/com/sun/tools/salsa/<stuff>
    Let's call the top-level directory $SALSA_EXTRACTOR.

3.  Type "ant" to build the extractor, and check that everything worked.

4.  Have a look at the "run" script to see if anything needs tweaking.  Look
    for the appropriate installation dir of the 1.5 JDK, and also add in any
    require jar files into the classpath option; for example, a J2EE system
    might need to have /opt/SUNWappserver/lib/j2ee.jar added.  The rule of
    thumb is that if you can build your system with javac 1.5, you should also
    be able to perform an extraction on it using the same settings for
    CLASSPATH.

5.  Try running the "run" script ("winrun" for Windows) by
	% ./run <target>
    <target> can either be a (set of) Java file(s), or a directory.
    Basically, the command-line use is like javac's.

6.  The extraction will create two plain text files: "factTuples.ta" and
    "factAttributes.ta".  To create a file you can use with QL, do this:
    	cat factTuples.ta factAttributes.ta > mySystemFacts.ta
    The filename you choose ("mySystemFacts.ta") is not important as long as
    it has a ".ta" extension.  
    
    There is a diagram of the meta model that the extractor uses in:
	$SALSA_EXTRACTOR/doc/metaModelDiagrams/JavaMetaModel.jpg

7.  You can now use this fact file to run QL queries!  The first line of
    your QL script will probably be "getta mySystemFacts.ta"
