At time of writing, these documents have been lifted from the Jackpot
repository.  Almost everything that is said here is still true, except that
I'm still trying to get the extraction of facts about library entities to
work in the salsa version (this worked fine within Jackpot).  

I will adapt these documents for SALSA use Real Soon Now.
