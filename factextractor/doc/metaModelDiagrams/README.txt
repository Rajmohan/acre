This directory contains a diagram of the current meta model for the
extractor.  The "working" file is a zipped XML file that the tool MagicDraw
understands.   There should also be a JPG with a dump of the current
diagram.

MagicDraw is a tool I've been using at the University of Waterloo for a
couple of years, since it's free to researchers.  You may want to check out
the license possibilities tho for use within Sun.  I'm really just using it
as a UML drawing tool.  Other tools may also do a similar job.  One
freeware possibility is the drawing too "dia".  There is also a web page of
UML tools I maintain at:
	http://plg.uwaterloo.ca/~migod/uml/

Note that the JPG picture should be good enough for anyone who is not
actually wanting to change the meta model diagram.
