ACRE - Application Characteristics Repository Environment
============================================================
Version 0.1
Licensed per Apache 2.0 License. See LICENSE file for details.

Steps to compile and run ACRE:
=================================
1. Make sure you have installed J2SE 1.5 or later.
The compile depends on tools.jar from J2SE 1.5
2. Modify the build.properties to point to the J2SE 1.5 installation.
3. Run ant to compile:
    % ant clean
    % ant all
4. Create Database, see steps below before proceeding to #5
5. Run ant to run the ACRE UI:
    % ant run

Creating the ACRE Database
================================
1. Install MySQL (4.1.5 or later). Modify the "path" variable to include mysql bins.
2. Create a database (schema) "salsa"
3. Create a user "salsa", password "salsa"
   Assign all privileges to salsa user on salsa database
4. Create the tables in "salsa" database by running the script:
   % scripts/createfactdb.sh
5. Run factextractor target using the runfact.bat file. Modify the script as necessary.
6. Alternatively, you can import an example database from the mysqldbdump file
with filename of "psa.salsa.db.dump" located under factextractor/db directory.

Running Configuration Settings
====================================
If the application does not start and you want to set the configuration
settings (such as DBURL, password, etc.), run the runconfig target
in the build.xml:
    % ant runconfig
This will bring up the configuration window without starting
all of ACRE.

If you don't see anything under the Default System and Default
Version combo boxes, it means that there are no facts in the database.
Try populating/creating the data in the database first according to the
steps above before run configure again.
