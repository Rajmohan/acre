**!! WARNING !!**

Antidote currently depends on Sun's implementation of JAXP. and has
only been compiled/tested against version 1.1 of this library. The
reason for this is that the package org.apache.tools.ant.gui.acs
(where the XML parser handler lives) uses a set of publically exposed
classes that are part of the "com.sun.xml" structure which are not
part of the JAXP specification.

Why was such a crazy, non-standard thing done? Because the classes
XmlDocumentBuilder and SimpleElementFactory in the package
com.sun.xml.tree enabled the rapid creation of a data model that
allowed Antidote to quicly become a useful application.

Don't like it? Then help us fix it! :-) Basically a SAX handler needs
to be implemented that builds a DOM whose element nodes are instances
of specific types in the org.apache.tools.ant.gui.acs pakcage based on
the element tag name.
